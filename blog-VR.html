                    <p>For the last four years, I was the director at a non-profit that raised money for a women's safe home loacted in Nepal. We relied upon volunteer trips to connect supporters to our mission and the women and children that we serve. People would return from the trip a better idea of where their donations go and they are more likely to ask other people to support our organization. 10 - 30 people would visit per year, raising tens of thousands of dollars and further expanding our donor base. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Then the pandemic hit.</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Volunteers were no longer able to visit the safe home for almost two years and it became harder to reach new supporters and garner loyalty to our organization. With AR and VR, non-profit organiizations can bring the experience to the supporter! If my organization had the resources, we could create a virtual reality tour of the safe home and "meet" the staff as well as some of the women and children. There could even be tour of the villages that many of the children come from.</p>

                    <p>Check out some <a href ="https://www.nptechforgood.com/2019/09/04/how-organizations-can-use-vr-and-ar-tech-for-fundraising" target="_blank">more examples</a> of how non-pofit organizations can utilize this technology. I especially like the <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/407677/white-noise-augmented-reality/" target="_blank">AR reef</a> to demonstrate the effects of pollution on the world's coral reefs.</p>
