                <p>I love mountain biking though I haven't gone out as much as I would like. Which means I haven't invested as much money in my bike and bike components compared to some die-hard bikers. But it's always fun to see what new and expensive gadget or bike is out on the market, such as the E-Mountain bike which can be considered cheating, but it helps you stay out on the trails longer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One new gadget that came out in 2019 is Fox's Live Valve electronic suspension system. It automatically adjusts your bike's fork and shock to suit changes in terrain. And it makes adjustments in milliseconds! No more stopping and manually adjusting your suspension when switching from smooth to bumpy trails or from uphill to downhill.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Additionally, you have the option to manually adjust the suspension settings from the smartphone app to fit your preference. There are different modes such as Sport for faster performance and Comfy which is slower, but will ensure you don't turn into a human maraca.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There is no price listed on the website so it's safe to assume it's out of my price range at the moment.</p>
