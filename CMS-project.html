                <p>Artifical intelligence can help non-profits segment their supporters by certain actions that they are likely to take. Such as giving monthly, making a major gift, attending a fundraiser, or will only give a one-time gift. It can assist in developing effective fundraising campaigns directed at each donor segment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>AI is so important for non-profits, especially for smaller ones with small teams who don't have a data analyst to dive into the massive amount of donor data. Recently this technology has beomce more accessible to organizations with smaller budgets.</p>
                <br>
                <p>How does this work? First, the AI will extract donation and engagement data from the organization's customer relationship management (CRM) software and will organize the data by markers such as age, date of the most recent gift, or gift amount.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Next, the AI analyzes the data and predict how likely an individual will take a certain action (donate again, donate for certain appeals, etc.) These predictions are exported to the CRM to assist in creating targeted campaigns aimed at increasing donor retention, giving frequency, or gift size.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This technology will save organizations time and money while increasing donations! Which menas non-profits can put more resources toward their mission. </p>
