            <div class ="article-content">
                <p>You may be wondering why I chose a nature theme for a tech blog. While I love learning about new technologies, I also enjoy occassionally getting away from computers and phones to recharge myself and the best way to do that for me is to get outside. When I can (i.e. when the weather is cooperating) I even try to work outside and find I'm better able to focus.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Maybe you aren't reading this blog outside, so I thought I would bring the outdoors to the reader to emanate a sense of calm and induce focus. I didn't want something that hit the reader right in the face, since we get enough of that throughout our daily lives and at the end of the day is overwhelming. </p>
                <br>
                <p>So please enjoy as I talk about some tech that I'm excited about.</p>
