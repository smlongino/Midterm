    <div><h2>You Can Become a Novelist...Sort Of...</h2></div>
    <div><p>If you're like me, writing may just not come naturally to you, especially when it comes to creative writing. So when I discovered there were AI's out there that could write a novel, I was intrigued. I tried out <a href = "https://novelai.net/"> NovelAI</a> </p>
    
    <p>At NovelAI, all you have to do is enter a prompt and it will start writing a story based on that prompt - pretty cool! Though the story sometimes made no sense, many sentences were repetitive and it never really had a plot or a story arc, but it helped me get some creative juices flowing. Sometimes I would start with a prompt, but then turned into an ad for a game. It even comes up with  descriptions and tag lines.</p>
    <p>I think my favorite was this story:</p>
    <br>

    <p>I think Lita has had enough of John and his silly questions.</p>


    <p>So while this AI is great to grab some sentences and ideas, it definitely won't replace a human novelist.</p>
