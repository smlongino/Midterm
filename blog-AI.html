                <p>If you're like me, writing may just not come naturally to you, especially when it comes to creative writing. So when I discovered there were AI's out there that could write a novel, I was intrigued. I tried out <a href = "https://novelai.net/" target="_blank"> NovelAI</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>At NovelAI, all you have to do is enter a prompt and it will start writing a story based on that prompt - pretty cool! Though the story sometimes made no sense, many sentences were repetitive and it never really had a plot or a story arc, but it helped me get some creative juices flowing. Sometimes I would start with a prompt, but then turned into an ad for a game. It even comes up with  descriptions and tag lines./p>
                <br>
                <p>I think my favorite was this story:</p>

                <br>
                <p>I think Lita has had enough of John and his silly questions.augmented-reality/" target="_blank">AR reef</a> to demonstrate the effects of pollution on the world's coral reefs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So while this AI is great to grab some sentences and ideas, it definitely won't replace a human novelist.</p>
