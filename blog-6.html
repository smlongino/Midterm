                <p>Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, going camping or lounging on a beach, the PackPoint app is essential! You just enter your gender, destination, trip dates, select if it's for business or leisure, and select the activities you are planning on the trip. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The app automatically generates a packing list based on your selections and the weather forecast at the destination. You can customize the list as needed and check items off as you pack them. You can also create custom activities with the premium app.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The lists can be very detailed, even going as far as listing birth control pills (automatically lists this if you're female), chapstick, contacts (I didn't mention I wear contacts or glasses), and earplugs and eye mask. You can of course remove items if they don't apply to you.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>For the parents, you can tell the app you have a baby and it will generate a loooong list of things to bring for your little one. I know how much choas can ensue if you forget their pacificier or toys so it's nice not to have to think about making a packing list.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You can save your list for repeating trips. Some people even create a daily packing before they head to work. You can also share the list with fellow travelers.</p>
